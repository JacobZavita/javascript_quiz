# javascript_quiz

Javascript quiz created in javascript

# Contents of Project
This project contains an index.html file, javascript.js file, reset.css, and style.css file.

# Goals for Project
Here is the story I was given for this project:
+AS A coding bootcamp student
+I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
+SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

# Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
```

# How It Works
User is brought to a page with a "Start Quiz" button.

When the button is clicked a timer starts at 75 seconds along with the first multiple-choice question. As the user selects their answer by clicking on the one they think is correct, the user is given notice if their answer was correct or not. If correct, their score goes up by one (score is only displayed at the end of the round). If incorrect, not points are docked but five seconds is deleted from the timer.
